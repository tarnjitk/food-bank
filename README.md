# Ottawa Food Bank Project
The goal of this project is to help the Ottawa Food Bank understand the demand they experience for food: where is the demand, what affects it, and can we predict the demand?

# Getting started
* This project is based on a basecamp site. If you’re not already connected to it and want to contribute, please contact [Peter](http://www.meetup.com/DataforGood-Ottawa/members/130946522/) and tell him what you’d like to work on and we’ll get you set up.

# Files
* An introduction to the dataset in R is in the `/docs` folder
* Some code that does analytic work on the data is in the `/SAS` folder
